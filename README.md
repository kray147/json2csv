# ðŸŽ¶ json2csv: The Ultimate Spotify Data Alchemist ðŸŽ¶

Welcome to **json2csv**, where raw Spotify data gets transformed into shiny, easy-to-handle CSV files! ðŸš€

## ðŸŒŸ What's the Deal?

Tired of dealing with messy JSON files? Sick of quotes, commas, and all those special characters causing chaos in your data? We've got your back! json2csv converts your Spotify streaming history from JSON to CSV with ease and a sprinkle of magic.

## ðŸ˜Ž Features

- **Super Simple Conversion:** Just run the script and watch your JSON transform into CSV.
- **Handles Special Characters:** No more pulling your hair out over commas in artist names.
- **Quick and Efficient:** Get your data ready in no time.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. If not, download it from [here](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

Clone the repo and change into the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/json2csv.git
cd json2csv
```

### Usage

Run the script and follow the prompts:

```bash
python json2csv.py
```

When prompted, enter the full filename of your JSON file (e.g., `Streaming_History_Audio_2023_4.json`). 

```python
What file do you want to change? (submit the whole filename with extension): 
```

And voilÃ ! Your CSV file is ready to use. ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

1. **Read Your JSON File:** It starts by asking for your JSON file.
2. **Splits the Data:** Cleverly splits the data, even handling those pesky commas in names.
3. **Writes to CSV:** Converts and writes everything into a neat CSV file.



## ðŸ¤“ Fun Facts

- This project was developed at the peak of caffeine-induced genius at 4 AM. â˜•
- I tried to get chatgpt to write me the weird function that splits everything apart but he did something so complicated for nothing i just rewrote it myself lmao
- The script's design philosophy is inspired by the mantra: "Make it work, make it right, make it fast." ðŸš€

Happy Converting! ðŸŽ‰
